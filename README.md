The folder 'code_PLRNN_BOLD_SSM' found in the zip-file contains code of the probabilistic fMRI state space model ('PLRNN-BOLD-SSM' and 'LDS-BOLD-SSM'), as well as experimental data described in the journal article. For an example of how to start the code and run the algorithm on the given data set (including 'Algorithm-1'), please run 'Main_data_example.m'.

The folder 'code_PLRNN_SSM' found in the zip-file contains code of the probabilistic state space model ('PLRNN-SSM' and 'LDS-SSM'), as well as self-generated benchmark system data obtained from the Lorenz and van der Pol systems described in the journal article. For an example of how to start the code and run the algorithm on the given data set (including 'Algorithm-1'), please run 'Main_benchmark_example.m'.
